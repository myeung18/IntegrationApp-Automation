# IntegrationApp Automation


## Demo Story

An integration application consisting of Multiple services working in combination (single front end with dispatch to two back-ends), one or more APIs that need to be managed via 3scale, and one or more messaging destinations/addresses used for event-driven inputs and outputs. Now want to automate deployment of this application across multiple environments, using pre-defined pipelines provided by the platform. The delivery pipelines must support environment-specific properties, testing, versioning, and the ability to rollback incomplete or failed deployments.

 Steps
 
     • Design an application using Fuse, AMQ, and 3Scale.
     • Source to Image (S2I) build and deploy apps on openshift environment.
     • Building a pipeline to support automated CI/CD
     • Expose a REST API using Camel, and export API doc to swagger.
     • Publish API on 3scale environment using CI/CD pipeline.
     • Manage the API through 3scale API management and update the application plan to rate-limit the application.
     • Design a web application that makes its calls through the 3scale API gateway.

## Application Environment

This demo contains below applications.

    • Gateway application https://github.com/redhatHameed/3ScaleFuseAMQ/tree/master/maingateway-service 
    • User Service application https://github.com/redhatHameed/3ScaleFuseAMQ/tree/master/fisuser-service
    • Alert Service Application https://github.com/redhatHameed/3ScaleFuseAMQ/tree/master/fisalert-service
    • Node.js Web application https://github.com/redhatHameed/3ScaleFuseAMQ/tree/master/nodejsalert-ui
    • 3scale (Openshift on-premises) environment

### Automation of Applications in OpenShift.

**Build and deploy with pipelines**

***Install OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 in [CDK 3.0](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/)***

Download the git repository by either forking, or simply cloning it. 

```
git clone https://github.com/myeung18/IntegrationApp-Automation.git
```
Start up your OpenShift environment by running

```
minishift start --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>
oc login -u developer
```

Setup `rh-dev`, `rh-test` and `rh-prod` OpenShift projects as the CICD target environment (you may skip this step if you already have the environment ready, and this script will first delete the original projects in OpenShift and create new ones).
    
```
./setup/setup.sh <openshfit userId>  #e.g. developer
```

Import the pipeline templates into your CICD project. For this case, it is `rh-dev`.

```
switch to rh-dev project
oc project rh-dev

[import fisuser-service pipeline]

`oc new-app -f fisuser-service/src/main/resources/pipeline-app-build.yml -p IMAGE_REGISTRY=<Image name space>`

[import maingateway-service pipeline]

`oc new-app -f maingateway-service/src/main/resources/pipeline-app-build.yml -p IMAGE_REGISTRY=<Image name space>`

[import nodejsalert-ui pipeline]

`oc new-app -f nodejsalert-ui/resources/pipeline-app-build.yml -p IMAGE_REGISTR=<Image name space>` 

[import fisalert-service pipeline]

`oc new-app -f fisalert-service/src/main/resources/pipeline-app-build.yml -p IMAGE_REGISTRY=<Image name space>`

[import integration-master-pipeline]

`oc new-app -f pipelinetemplates/pipeline-aggregated-build.yml -p IMAGE_REGISTRY=<Image name space>`

```

You can also customize the pipeline by changing the following the parameters:

```
GIT_REPO             https://github.com/RHsyseng/IntegrationApp-Automation.git
GIT_BRANCH           master            #git branch where you want to build
OPENSHIFT_HOST       <leave it for now, will be used in future release>
OPENSHIFT_TOKEN      <leave it for now, will be used in future release>
MODULE_NAME          <module_name>    #the Java/NodeJs sourcode module name for this template to build 
                                            e.g.: (maingateway-service/fisuser-service/fisalert-service/nodejsalert-ui)
CICD_PROJECT         rh-dev                
TEST_PROJECT         rh-test
PROD_PROJECT         rh-prod
MYSQL_USER           dbuser            #your DB user account
MYSQL_PWD            password          #DB user password
IMAGER_EGISTRY        172.30.1.1:5000   #image registry, usually is the one in your OpenShift where you do the build
IMAGE_NAMESPACE       rh-dev            #the namespace where you push the image in OpenShift
```
After you have imported all the pipeline templates, you should have them in your OpenShft under `Builds`, `Pipelines`.

![Pipeline View](images/pipeline_import_view.png "Pipeline View")

Please start the pipeline from `maingateway-service-pipeline`, `fisuser-service-pipeline`, `fisalert-service-pipeline`, and then `nodejsalert-ui-pipeline`.

With `integration-master-pipeline`, you can build the entire application including all of the above modules mentione. If you choose this pipeline, by default, it will build the entire application, but you will also be asked and to select which individual module you want to bulid.  You will need to make your selection in your Jenkins console.

Once the build are finished, in your OpenShift, go to `rh-test` or `rh-prod`, nevigate to `Applications`, `Routes` and click on nodejsalert-ui URL to launch the application.
You should see the application and it is started with web front-end like this:
